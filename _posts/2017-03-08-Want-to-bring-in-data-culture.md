When organizations embark on path to bring in data driven culture in their organization, they often encounter a gap between strategy and action too daunting to achieve any results. The operations and mid-management are busy with their everyday tasks and they do not seem to apply same priority to the newly defined tasks.

Why Strategy does not Translate into Implementation?

The reasons behind inability to translate strategy into action are many but some are repeated across organizations: 

The most common impediment encountered is lack of proper planning to translate strategy into a series of implementable actions, which can be assigned to leaders, allocate necessary resources for and analyzed for risks from both internal and external sources.

Companies are generally divided into separate protectorates, and turf wars prevent effective implementation of strategy. Many organizations do not understand the importance of aligning reward and recognition schemes of individual managers to the overall strategy resulting in lack of common goals. These get augmented if there is also lack of capability among managers and supervisors to complete the activities assigned for implemention of the strategy.


How to Plan?

A simple but effective tool that can help companies undertake strategic prioritisation and translate strategy into action is the Ease of Doing/Impact Matrix.

Typically, after we are engaged, we conduct a review of the company structure and their divisions to identify the high level actions required subject to whatever starting point the organisation has. 

Then, after detailed brainstorming and deep analysis, we follow following steps:

Step1: Define Clear Goal

It is necessary to clearly define what the goal of the strategy is. The strategy should have a clear single goal. At this stage, a clear measure can also be defined which would indicate failure of the target goal. 

Step 2: Design the quadrant Matrix
List all the required activities and assign a score, on a scale of one to five, to each of them to determine extent to which it will impact the goal and the ease of execution. Then plot the activities on a matrix where the one axis is the ease of doing and other axis is the impact on the goal. 

Now review each quadrant of the matrix and prioritise the activities:

High impact/ Easy to execute: Prioritise these activities as the first to do. It will help get some early success and these activities will help convince doubting thomases to shed their scepticism and align themselves for more difficult activities.

High impact/ Difficult to execute: Carefully spend enough time planning these activities. Poor outcomes in execution of these activities have potential to derail the whole strategy, especially if some team members are not fully supportive of the strategy. 

Low Impact/ Easy to execute: Only do these activities if they are a precursor to activities with greater impact.

Low Impact/ Difficult to execute: Only do these these activities if they are a precursor to activities with greater impact. 

Implementation Plan:
Plan the activities in quarterly (90 days) blocks. Plan first two quarters in detail and at the end of each quarter adjust the plan based on actual achievements to date. Two to four weeks before end of the planned period, add another block of detailed planning to have a rolling annual plan. This helps to plan resources without needing a crystal ball and keep execution in control..
