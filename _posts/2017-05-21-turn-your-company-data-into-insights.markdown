More Data does not convert into actionable information by itself. Big Data does not create value, Data Science does. Data Science is not about data scientists, it’s about passion for informed decision making.

Data Science stands on three-pillars - business acumen, data wrangling and data analytics - to create value. It requires marrying the hard science skills with the knowledge about a particular business. These together with wrangling of relevant data bring insights to the table.

It’s one thing to know how to play with numbers, but it’s more important to understand what insights these numbers reveal on the business, and what actions to take based on these insights. Experience and business knowledge plays a role, as well as curiosity and passion for numbers.

Sometimes the best results come from unlikely people just because of their desire and persistence. Look for those people.

Turning Data into Insights in 7-steps:

Formulate business problem definition by asking series of right questions until you arrive at the core. Make a matrix of ease of implementation and corresponding impact to prioritize. Well begun is half done.

Source, clean and transform your data sources. Seeking the most representative data for the problem definition is a key task.

Transform available data to address the business problem. This is time-consuming but crucial. The best analytics or machine learning algorithms can’t make up for poor quality data.

Clearly define the explanatory features and response variables that correspond to the business problem. This is central to deriving actionable insights.

Create predictive models and rules that encapsulate the insights for analysis and action. Getting this right will give your repeated best results.

Prepare visualizations and dashboards highlighting the key response variables and explanatory features. The visualizations need to be crisp and insightful so that business users can quickly derive insights on the business issues.

Refresh source data as often as practical. Some data don’t change very fast and/or can’t be actioned right away. In other cases, we can drive action intraday or even in the moment.
