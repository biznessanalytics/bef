Several research point out to findings that most M&A fail to create value. If that is correct, much of the blame goes to the current processes being applied for M&A. But does it have to remain that way? 

Today the traditional methods of M&A execution are being stress tested to their limits. There is incredible amount of data explosion happening which is rapidly making traditional ways of data handling and insight generation obsolete. Fortunately, the explosion of data has also been matched with rapid advances in advanced statistical analytical methods which can be deployed to keep pace. But most of the companies, both looking to buy and sell, and their advisors are far behind the curve.

This article explores at high level the ways by which advanced analytics and big data can help identify a merger combination, help company prepare its selling story, conduct thorough due diligence, identify and articulate with data backup synergy plans that both parties can agree, test scenarios for the combination from market perspective and bring high level of confidence in the forecasts that underpin the valuations.

From our rich experience of dealing with several mergers and acquisitions, we identify below some of the most common challenges faced throughout the M&A process and how data analytics can help.

## Identifying Targets
Mergers or acquisitions should be an outcome of a well thought out strategic and structured plan, arrived at after carefully exploring how inorganic growth or business combination will enhance the company’s competitive positioning or solve the pain points. For this to happen, a diligent and thorough market research should precede outreaches, and a market scenario analysis pre and post transaction shall be conducted. This is where data analytics has a critical role to play.

Today, a large amount of information exists in various structured and unstructured form that can be collated and analyzed to extract useful insights. Using data analytics while planning a business combination can help companies visualise the context, make comparisons, combinations, identify areas of improvement or redundancy of duplicate resources and form views on the value creation. Once in the process, predictive techniques can be used to see how the combination is likely to evolve after a deal is made. Ultimately, one needs to remember the unforgiving nature of M&A decision and it is imperative that detailed and throrough preparation is done, specific analysis is conducted before taking steps for such an important transformative decision.

## Making Sense of Mountains of Data
Today, data is doubling in size every two years, and businesses need to rapidly enhance their data analysing abilities to handle it effectively. While the businesses of all sizes are drowning in data, legacy mid size companies are finding it most challenging due to them being behind the curve from new entrants. This is a challenge that clearly needs to be overcome during the course of regular business, but it becomes even greater during a merger or acquisition where all this data needs to be put to work in a compressed timeframe.

Most of the companies today do not have a data architecture in place. One invariably finds that organizational data is stored in different silos and wrapped in layers of organizational hierarchy. Market information data is held separately from customer data which is held separately from financial data which remains separate from HR data and so on. Analyzing the company requires all these disparate data sets to be brought together, provide context to each other and interact, so that actionable intelligence across can be generated. If the data to be converted to information, it can generate valuable insights and the business models can be built more fluidly. Without advanced analytics tools and skills, these opportunities will be missed.

## Not Having to Choose Between Speed and Depth
There is an inherent contradiction at play in all M&A situations: while there is a need to analyze as much data as possible and be comprehensive and exhaustive, there is always a severe time constraint of weeks if not days. When you enter the game you need to decide that as a business, what is more important: being thorough or getting the deal quickly? Financial investors have mastered their processes for squeezed timeline and have larger tolerance for risks which makes them a dominant player in the M&A market. This choice keeps several business owners away from the M&A market thereby severely constraining their growth potential.

This is where having a data culture and being prepared comes handy. There is some data that needs curation time since it can be unstructured and in irregular forms, there is some data that will be accessed only once the wheels of deals are rotating, but there still is volume of data that can be extracted in advance and kept ready to be put to work immediately. Since companies do not, and should not, embark on M&A suddenly they can work with experts to create frame work with the fast data and curate the slow data in advance to already build the context for the specific data to come, enrich and fill in colors.  This however needs companies to have an information architecture as part of their M&A strategy.

## Managing Post Acquisition Culture Clash
When two companies combine, there is inevitable clash of cultures, personalities and ideas. Business leaders may have vastly different perceptions and analysis of the market. Still, there is a need to make work with the existing leaderships of departments and markets. If ideas and perceptions are not backed by hard data, it can result in clashes and lack of acceptance. In order to define a new organisational culture, it generally works more smoothly if managers and employees have access to company data which evidently supports a view in order to drive acceptance of informed business decisions.

Today, data analytics provides an unprecedented opportunity to build upon employee interest and encourage data backed decision making to thrive in this data-driven market place. It creates a natural cultural bond where the arguments are made backed by data rather than on 'experience' or 'gut feels'.

There is a common refrain that most M&As fail to create value. Successful acquisitions are differentiated by the throroughness of diligence. A business combination succeeds or fails based on the participants decision rooted in an accurate, timely and effective data analysis.

With the twin power of big data and tools of big data analytics, time has come to turn the tide towards more M&As creating value.
