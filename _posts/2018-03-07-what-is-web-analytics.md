What is Web Analytics and Why to use it ?
Every company, regardless of size, requires multiple tools to understand the performance of its website, happiness of its customers and gain key context from competitors. 
Management thinker Peter Drucker is often quoted as saying that "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it."
Drucker means that you can't know, you are successful unless success is defined and tracked. With a clearly established metric for success, you can quantify progress and adjust your process to produce the desired outcome. Without clear objectives, you are stuck in a constant state of guessing.
Web analytics is the process of analyzing the behavior of visitors to a Web site. The use of Web analytics is said to enable a business to attract more visitors, retain both old and new customers for goods or services, or to increase the cost each customer spends.
Web analytics is often used as part of customer relationship management analytics (CRM analytics). The analysis can include determining the probability that a customer will repurchase a product after having purchased it in the past, personalizing the site to customers who visit it repeatedly according to their browsing history, monitoring the dollar volume of purchases made by individual customers or by specific groups of customers, observing the geographic regions from which the most and the least customers visit the site and purchase specific products, and predicting which products customers are most and least likely to buy in the future. The objective is to promote specific products to those customers most likely to buy them, and to determine which products a specific customer is most likely to purchase. This can help to design and create specific marketing campaigns and improve the ratio of revenue to marketing costs.
To ensure that the website is achieving the results you expect, you really need have Web Analytics in place. Analytics enables you to determine the weaknesses and strengths of your website, and to set goals to track and maximize progress and success. If you have a website, then most important questions are: 
- Does your website fulfil your goal for which it was made, are people visiting your website or not? 
- Are you monitoring your website traffic, page views, sessions and goals to ensure your site becomes a driving force of revenue?
- What are the contents people are looking at and what contents are ignored?
- How to customize your website to increase customer retention?
In short, Analytics helps to make decisions based on data. You can justify spending more on your advertising, discover where you should be advertising, and even determine what types of content you need to be putting out there.
